    <div id="wikipedia" style='display: none'>
     <br>
    <br>
    <a href="collection.html">Green</a> is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495–570 nm. In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. By far the largest contributor to <a href="collection.html">green</a> in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their <a href="collection.html">green</a> environments by taking on a <a href="collection.html">green</a> hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a <a href="collection.html">green</a> color, including the emerald, which is colored <a href="collection.html">green</a> by its chromium content.
    <br>
    <br>
    During post-classical and early modern Europe, <a href="collection.html">green</a> was the color commonly associated with wealth, merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. For this reason, the costume of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci and the benches in the British House of Commons are <a href="collection.html">green</a> while those in the House of Lords are red. It also has a long historical tradition as the color of Ireland and of Gaelic culture. It is the historic color of Islam, representing the lush vegetation of Paradise. It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries.
    <br>
    <br>
    In surveys made in American, European, and Islamic countries, <a href="collection.html">green</a> is the color most commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope, and envy. In the European Union and the United States, <a href="collection.html">green</a> is also sometimes associated with toxicity and poor health, but in China and most of Asia, its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental movement. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the <a href="collection.html">Green</a> movement, some naming themselves <a href="collection.html">Green</a> parties. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold <a href="collection.html">green</a>, or environmentally friendly, products. <a href="collection.html">Green</a> is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a <a href="collection.html">green</a> light means go ahead, a <a href="collection.html">green</a> card permits permanent residence in the United States.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Biology</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="collection.html">Green</a> is common in nature, as many plants are <a href="collection.html">green</a> because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear <a href="collection.html">green</a> to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in <a href="collection.html">green</a>. Chlorophyll absorbs <a href="collection.html">green</a> light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the <a href="collection.html">green</a> portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.
    <br>
    <br>
    Animals typically use the color <a href="collection.html">green</a> as camouflage, blending in with the chlorophyll <a href="collection.html">green</a> of the surrounding environment. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear <a href="collection.html">green</a> because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-<a href="collection.html">green</a> light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a <a href="collection.html">green</a> hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display <a href="collection.html">green</a> colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look <a href="collection.html">green</a> as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to <a href="collection.html">greenness</a> among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing <a href="collection.html">green</a> clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a <a href="collection.html">greenish</a> hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the <a href="collection.html">green</a> pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.
    <br>
    <br>
    The <a href="collection.html">green</a> huntsman spider is <a href="collection.html">green</a> due to the presence of bilin pigments in  the spider's hemolymph (circulatory system fluids) and tissue fluids. It hunts insects in <a href="collection.html">green</a> vegetation, where it is well camouflaged.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Ancient history</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    In Ancient Egypt, <a href="collection.html">green</a> was the symbol of regeneration and rebirth, and of the crops made possible by the annual flooding of the Nile. For painting on the walls of tombs or on papyrus, Egyptian artists used finely ground malachite, mined in the west Sinai and the eastern desert; a paintbox with malachite pigment was found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun. They also used less expensive <a href="collection.html">green</a> earth pigment, or mixed yellow ochre and blue azurite. To dye fabrics <a href="collection.html">green</a>, they first colored them yellow with dye made from saffron and then soaked them in blue dye from the roots of the woad plant.
    <br>
    <br>
    For the ancient Egyptians, <a href="collection.html">green</a> had very positive associations. The hieroglyph for <a href="collection.html">green</a> represented a growing papyrus sprout, showing the close connection between <a href="collection.html">green</a>, vegetation, vigor and growth. In wall paintings, the ruler of the underworld, Osiris, was typically portrayed with a <a href="collection.html">green</a> face, because <a href="collection.html">green</a> was the symbol of good health and rebirth. Palettes of <a href="collection.html">green</a> facial makeup, made with malachite, were found in tombs. It was worn by both the living and the dead, particularly around the eyes, to protect them from evil. Tombs also often contained small <a href="collection.html">green</a> amulets in the shape of scarab beetles made of malachite, which would protect and give vigor to the deceased. It also symbolized the sea, which was called the "Very <a href="collection.html">Green</a>."
    <br>
    <br>
    In Ancient Greece, <a href="collection.html">green</a> and blue were sometimes considered the same color, and the same word sometimes described the color of the sea and the color of trees. The philosopher Democritus described two different <a href="collection.html">greens</a>: cloron, or pale <a href="collection.html">green</a>, and prasinon, or leek <a href="collection.html">green</a>. Aristotle considered that <a href="collection.html">green</a> was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, <a href="collection.html">green</a> was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Romans had a greater appreciation for the color <a href="collection.html">green</a>; it was the color of Venus, the goddess of gardens, vegetables and vineyards. The Romans made a fine <a href="collection.html">green</a> earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Lyon, Vaison-la-Romaine, and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine. By the second century AD, the Romans were using <a href="collection.html">green</a> in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of <a href="collection.html">green</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Postclassical history</h3>
    <br>
    <br>  
    In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the color of clothing showed a person's social rank and profession. Red could only be worn by the nobility, brown and gray by peasants, and <a href="collection.html">green</a> by merchants, bankers and the gentry and their families. The Mona Lisa wears <a href="collection.html">green</a> in her portrait, as does the bride in the Arnolfini portrait by Jan van Eyck.
    <br>
    <br>
    There were no good vegetal <a href="collection.html">green</a> dyes which resisted washing and sunlight for those who wanted or were required to wear <a href="collection.html">green</a>. <a href="collection.html">Green</a> dyes were made out of the fern, plantain, buckthorn berries, the juice of nettles and of leeks, the digitalis plant, the broom plant, the leaves of the fraxinus, or ash tree, and the bark of the alder tree, but they rapidly faded or changed color. Only in the 16th century was a good <a href="collection.html">green</a> dye produced, by first dyeing the cloth blue with woad, and then yellow with Reseda luteola, also known as yellow-weed.
    <br>
    <br>
    The pigments available to painters were more varied; monks in monasteries used verdigris, made by soaking copper in fermenting wine, to color medieval manuscripts. They also used finely-ground malachite, which made a luminous <a href="collection.html">green</a>. They used <a href="collection.html">green</a> earth colors for backgrounds.
    <br>
    <br>
    During the early Renaissance, painters such as Duccio di Buoninsegna learned to paint faces first with a <a href="collection.html">green</a> undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look <a href="collection.html">green</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    The 18th and 19th centuries brought the discovery and production of synthetic <a href="collection.html">green</a> pigments and dyes, which rapidly replaced the earlier mineral and vegetable pigments and dyes. These new dyes were more stable and brilliant than the vegetable dyes, but some contained high levels of arsenic, and were eventually banned.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Modern history: In the 18th and 19th century </h3>

    <br>
    <br>
    In the 18th and 19th centuries, <a href="collection.html">green</a> was associated with the romantic movement in literature and art. The German poet and philosopher Goethe declared that <a href="collection.html">green</a> was the most restful color, suitable for decorating bedrooms. Painters such as John Constable and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot depicted the lush <a href="collection.html">green</a> of rural landscapes and forests. <a href="collection.html">Green</a>was contrasted to the smoky grays and blacks of the Industrial Revolution.
    <br>
    <br>
    The second half of the 19th century saw the use of <a href="collection.html">green</a> in art to create specific emotions, not just to imitate nature. One of the first to make color the central element of his picture was the American artist James McNeil Whistler, who created a series of paintings called "symphonies" or "noctures" of color, including Symphony in gray and <a href="collection.html">green</a>; The Ocean between 1866 and 1872.
    <br>
    <br>
    The late 19th century also brought the systematic study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and <a href="collection.html">green</a> reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as Vincent van Gogh. Describing his painting, The Night Cafe, to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: "I sought to express with red and <a href="collection.html">green</a> the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a <a href="collection.html">green</a> billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and <a href="collection.html">greens</a>."

    <h2 class="header3" onclick="toggleText3()"> THE COLOR PSYCHOLOGY OF GREEN</h2>

    <div id="psychology" style='display: none'>
    <br>
    <br>
    Color psychology suggests that different colors can evoke psychological reactions. For example, color is often thought to have an impact on moods and emotions. Sometimes these reactions are related to the intensity of a color, while in other cases they are the product of experience and cultural influences.
    <br>
    <br>
    How does the color <a href="collection.html">green</a> make you feel? For many people, it has strong associations with nature and immediately brings to mind the lush <a href="collection.html">green</a> of grass, trees, and forests. Perhaps because <a href="collection.html">green</a> is so heavily associated with nature, it is often described as a refreshing and tranquil color.
    <br>
    <br>
    "<a href="collection.html">Green</a>, which is Nature's colour, is restful, soothing, cheerful, and health-giving." —Paul Brunton
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>The Color Psychology of <a href="collection.html">Green</a></h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="collection.html">Green</a> is a cool color that symbolizes nature and the natural world. Perhaps because of its strong associations with nature, <a href="collection.html">green</a> is often thought to represent tranquility, good luck, health, and jealousy.
    <br>
    <br>
    Researchers have also found that <a href="collection.html">green</a> can improve reading ability. Some students may find that laying a transparent sheet of <a href="collection.html">green</a> paper over reading material increases reading speed and comprehension.
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="collection.html">Green</a> has long been a symbol of fertility and was once the preferred color choice for wedding gowns in the 15th-century. Even today, green M&M's (an American chocolate candy) are said to send a sexual message.
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="collection.html">Green</a> is often used in decorating for its calming effect. For example, guests waiting to appear on television programs often wait in a “<a href="collection.html">green</a> room” to relax.
    <br>
    <br>
   <a href="collection.html">Green</a> is thought to relieve stress and help heal. Those who have a <a href="collection.html">green</a> work environment experience fewer stomachaches.
    <br>
    <br>
    Consider how <a href="collection.html">green</a> is used in language: <a href="collection.html">green</a> thumb, <a href="collection.html">green</a> with envy, <a href="collection.html">greenhorn</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>The Effects of <a href="collection.html">Green</a></h3>
    How does <a href="collection.html">green</a> make you feel? Do you associate <a href="collection.html">green</a> with certain qualities or situations?
    <br>
    <br>
    How Do We Perceive Color?
    <h3><a href="collection.html">Green</a> Is Calming</h3>
    Readers often suggest that the color <a href="collection.html">green</a> has a calming effect. "I read somewhere that <a href="collection.html">green</a> is a calming color or a color that helps concentration or something," suggested one respondent.
    <br>
    <br>
    "Dark <a href="collection.html">green</a> are so soothing. I've noticed that whenever I'm feeling nervous or anxious about something, sitting in my dark <a href="collection.html">green</a> living room makes me feel much more relaxed," explained another reader. "I guess that's why they have '<a href="collection.html">green</a> rooms' for actors to sit in before they go on stage. It probably helps them feel more grounded and calm."
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="collection.html">Green's</a> calming effects may be due to its associations with nature, which people often feel is relaxing and refreshing.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="collection.html">Green</a> Is Exciting</h3>
    While some find <a href="collection.html">green</a> a relaxing color, others find that it gives them a feeling of excitement. "<a href="collection.html">Green</a> gives me a rush. I buy everything in <a href="collection.html">green</a>, and like pictures with a lot of <a href="collection.html">green</a> in them. I like characters with <a href="collection.html">green</a> hair, eyes, clothes automatically. It gives me an endorphin rush, I think," said one viewer.
    <br>
    <br>
    This can be especially true of particularly vibrant shades of <a href="collection.html">green</a>. "I love a really bright, vibrant <a href="collection.html">green</a>! It seems so energetic and motivating. Like I always feel inspired and recharged whenever I'm around a bright chartreuse or lime <a href="collection.html">green</a>," explained a reader.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="collection.html">Green</a> Evokes Compassion</h3>
    "When I see someone is wearing the color <a href="collection.html">green</a>, I feel she is kind, helpful, caring and sympathetic. It is a color that just radiates compassion." – Yeganeh
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="collection.html">Green</a> Is Natural</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    "<a href="collection.html">Green</a> to me is a symbol of growth of nature. When I notice the color <a href="collection.html">green</a> it gives off a calming and peaceful feeling." – Brenden
    <br>
    <br>
    "The color <a href="collection.html">green</a> reminds me of the natural world. I love to incorporate <a href="collection.html">green</a> in my interior decor and wardrobe because it feels so close to nature." – Betty
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="collection.html">Green</a> Is Optimistic</h3>
    "Hopeful, optimistic, forgiven, energized, restful, royal, elegant, rich, healthy, playful, respected, responsible, wealthy, cautious, peaceful, warm, stable, tall, clean, stable, comforted, sturdy, strong, and compassionate. This is my favorite color, all shades and hues." – Joe
    <br>
    <br>
    "<a href="collection.html">Green</a> is a color that to me symbolizes a new beginning. I imagine a fresh <a href="collection.html">green</a> plant emerging from the soil. Whenever I'm trying to get motivated to tackle a new goal or start over on something, surrounding myself with <a href="collection.html">green</a> can be quite helpful." – Ivan
    <br>
    <br>
    Your own reaction to the color <a href="collection.html">green</a> is highly personal. Past experiences, as well as personal and cultural associations, can all play a role in how this color makes you feel.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>A Word From Verywell</h3>
    Because the color <a href="collection.html">green</a> is so associated with nature, people often describe it as natural, fresh, and restful. However, it is important to remember that all reactions to color are also shaped by cultural influences and individual experiences.
    <br>
    <br>
    The next time to find yourself observing the color <a href="collection.html">green</a>, whether it is in a room, in a painting, or in an outdoor setting, take a moment to consider the types of emotions and moods that the color tends to evoke.
